    "#\"product\" -> Neutral score\n",
    "#\"It's\" -> Neutral score\n",

    "#Negative scores: None\n",
    "#Neutral scores: \"this\" (0), \"product\" (0), \"It's\" (0), \"I\" (0)\n",
    "#The compound score formula is (sum of positive scores - sum of negative scores) / total number of words. Here, the formula becomes (0.5 + 0.8) / 6 = 0.2167.\n",

Only favourite people get recognized and will be awarded in Employee connect. 6. CEO of the company promises many things but nothing will happen until another connect 7. Just posing for pics with employee and liking post in linkedin by CEO is not enough . CEO should know what’s happening in the team. CEO only listen to his favourite people. 8. Favoritism & Nepotism are practiced at the best possible way. 9. They will say it’s hybrid, but your reporting manager will not let you take work from home but the reporting manager can take as many work from home and leave as they feel. 10. Your self-respect and dignity will be shaken quite often, no respect for employees 11. Managers are ruling people with no knowledge on team handling, they are here either because they stay longer at the company or know how to act in front of CEO and tend to harass & intimidate you or sometimes even threaten you\n",

This is just to even out the ratings from worst to average.-- 1. Employee benefits are ZERO. I mean, literally zero. Pay is below industry standard and upon asking the reply you will get is, \"Because it's Coimbatore location and we have more people ready to join for this salary!\". I mean, are you paying for my talent or what? 2. HIKE! Oh boy!! Where do I start from? It's like thriller movie. You don't know when you will get your hike, what is the process they used to arrive at this number and whatnot! Moreover you don't have a say in this! Once your hike is decided, that's it. No more negotiations! Better luck next year. I still remember every year we wait for our hike more than we wait for anything else. One year it will arrive soon, another year it will arrive toooooo late! No matter what work you do, it doesn't exactly translated into hike. Rather whatever company decides it will reflect in your hike. In general, it is ONE BIG JOKE!!! 3. Another great thing to mention, the PAY STRUCTURE. They spent a lot of time to make sure employee doesn't get any benefits at all. No matter what your salary is, they break it in such a way, you will get peanuts as EPF. I still don't understand why no one had the guts to question this and they are just happy they are getting paid. Even when my salary was less, I used to get PF higher than this. This is such daylight robbery in my opinion and employees should raise this concern, but I doubt if they will. 4. This company is devoid of any team activities that we heard so far in IT companies. Hell, even some small startups in Coimbatore treats employee well and the culture is good compared to this company. No Team lunch, no outings, no sports activities, nothing. I see some team leads and team members pitch in to take team out for lunch to celebrate and increase morale. It's just PATHETIC!!! All they want is that you work you butt off to earn them tons of money. 5. No respect for employees. Not in my such long experience I've ever faced such bad experience anywhere else. Seriously it will make you question yourself and your dignity will be shaken very often. 6. Reluctance to accept new technologies or trust new talents and assign work. The managers will pick their trusted old mates to lead project and to take decisions who will stick with older technologies instead of using cutting-edge technology to do the same job in much better way. Reason? They don't want employees to learn new and work, instead you do what you know for the rest of the life. 7. TIMING!!! This is pure idiocy which I've never seen in any company. You have to be there before 9am. If you will be late for 10 mins, there is a good chance you will be called up by some manager and get an earful for being late! But the same managers don't take into consideration that you were late the previous night due to some overloaded tasks being assigned. 8. Senior Management doesn't translate the views of those who sit in upper. This is my view. But I seriously doubt if the Upper management is so naive not to know this or if they choose wrong people intentionally. 9. Company started taking shape a year ago but now it is nowhere near what it could have achieved. Right people make the company and the same time, wrong people break the company. I won't be surprised if they fell flat on their face with their current directions towards projects, treating employees, high attrition rate etc. That would teach them a lesson or two. 10. HR is just a joke. Not there for employees but for the employer. And some silly, stupid rules that the management enforces sometime make you wonder whether you work in a Software Company or some retail shop. God knows what's running on the mind of people who make those rules when they brag about how they plan to go big. Oh, no! Not with this attitude! 11. Meetings are not to discuss critical business decision, but rather to announce what they plan to achieve and what snacks we can provide at cafeteria. Their seniors meeting is nothing short of stand-up comedy. I'd rate it 10/10 for comedy and it is like watching Seinfeld. 12. Managers, who are there just because they stay longer at the company tend to intimidate you, harass you and even straight-forward threatening like \"If you can't do this, then we will use another person!\". But the truth is that, those managers are good for nothing and I don't see any of them bring any value to the company. Yet, here they are, ruling people with no knowledge on team handling and professionalism. 13. No WFH culture. Even some small startups started adopting this and it will help people who really need it. But alas, they won't. It may be some emergency and need only half-a-day but you can't work the rest of the day from home. Instead you either go to office or stay at home by taking whole day off. 14. They expect you to join in company groups in messengers app and expect you to reply within seconds if a client messages in the group. Even in weekends! Yeah, right, we employees don't have life outside work, am I right? It is as if they own you. --I'm glad I ditched this company for much better one and I'm not only happy now, but learning something new and enjoying being at work. The environment is fun and activities are plenty and work culture is just how it should be. It made me realise how toxic this company was for me to feel this way. --\n",

      "--Before going into CONS, I'm pretty sure that there will be 2-3 reviews with 5 star rating after my review and I'm sure the chance of those reviews from actual employees would be slim. This is just to even out the ratings from worst to average.-- 1. Employee benefits are ZERO. I mean, literally zero. Pay is below industry standard and upon asking the reply you will get is, \"Because it's Coimbatore location and we have more people ready to join for this salary!\". I mean, are you paying for my talent or what? 2. HIKE! Oh boy!! Where do I start from? It's like thriller movie. You don't know when you will get your hike, what is the process they used to arrive at this number and whatnot! Moreover you don't have a say in this! Once your hike is decided, that's it. No more negotiations! Better luck next year. I still remember every year we wait for our hike more than we wait for anything else. One year it will arrive soon, another year it will arrive toooooo late! No matter what work you do, it doesn't exactly translated into hike. Rather whatever company decides it will reflect in your hike. In general, it is ONE BIG JOKE!!! 3. Another great thing to mention, the PAY STRUCTURE. They spent a lot of time to make sure employee doesn't get any benefits at all. No matter what your salary is, they break it in such a way, you will get peanuts as EPF. I still don't understand why no one had the guts to question this and they are just happy they are getting paid. Even when my salary was less, I used to get PF higher than this. This is such daylight robbery in my opinion and employees should raise this concern, but I doubt if they will. 4. This company is devoid of any team activities that we heard so far in IT companies. Hell, even some small startups in Coimbatore treats employee well and the culture is good compared to this company. No Team lunch, no outings, no sports activities, nothing. I see some team leads and team members pitch in to take team out for lunch to celebrate and increase morale. It's just PATHETIC!!! All they want is that you work you butt off to earn them tons of money. 5. No respect for employees. Not in my such long experience I've ever faced such bad experience anywhere else. Seriously it will make you question yourself and your dignity will be shaken very often. 6. Reluctance to accept new technologies or trust new talents and assign work. The managers will pick their trusted old mates to lead project and to take decisions who will stick with older technologies instead of using cutting-edge technology to do the same job in much better way. Reason? They don't want employees to learn new and work, instead you do what you know for the rest of the life. 7. TIMING!!! This is pure idiocy which I've never seen in any company. You have to be there before 9am. If you will be late for 10 mins, there is a good chance you will be called up by some manager and get an earful for being late! But the same managers don't take into consideration that you were late the previous night due to some overloaded tasks being assigned. 8. Senior Management doesn't translate the views of those who sit in upper. This is my view. But I seriously doubt if the Upper management is so naive not to know this or if they choose wrong people intentionally. 9. Company started taking shape a year ago but now it is nowhere near what it could have achieved. Right people make the company and the same time, wrong people break the company. I won't be surprised if they fell flat on their face with their current directions towards projects, treating employees, high attrition rate etc. That would teach them a lesson or two. 10. HR is just a joke. Not there for employees but for the employer. And some silly, stupid rules that the management enforces sometime make you wonder whether you work in a Software Company or some retail shop. God knows what's running on the mind of people who make those rules when they brag about how they plan to go big. Oh, no! Not with this attitude! 11. Meetings are not to discuss critical business decision, but rather to announce what they plan to achieve and what snacks we can provide at cafeteria. Their seniors meeting is nothing short of stand-up comedy. I'd rate it 10/10 for comedy and it is like watching Seinfeld. 12. Managers, who are there just because they stay longer at the company tend to intimidate you, harass you and even straight-forward threatening like \"If you can't do this, then we will use another person!\". But the truth is that, those managers are good for nothing and I don't see any of them bring any value to the company. Yet, here they are, ruling people with no knowledge on team handling and professionalism. 13. No WFH culture. Even some small startups started adopting this and it will help people who really need it. But alas, they won't. It may be some emergency and need only half-a-day but you can't work the rest of the day from home. Instead you either go to office or stay at home by taking whole day off. 14. They expect you to join in company groups in messengers app and expect you to reply within seconds if a client messages in the group. Even in weekends! Yeah, right, we employees don't have life outside work, am I right? It is as if they own you. --I'm glad I ditched this company for much better one and I'm not only happy now, but learning something new and enjoying being at work. The environment is fun and activities are plenty and work culture is just how it should be. It made me realise how toxic this company was for me to feel this way. --\n",
